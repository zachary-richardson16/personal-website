# Zachary Richardson Personal Website

## Last Updated: 10/9/2024


## Overview:
This is my personal website containing in depth descriptions of my relevant experiences and some of the projects I have created. This project serves two purposes: to learn more about the process of creating an html website through R Markdown, and to provide an interactive, online resume that can share my experiences with potential employers and other interested people in my industry.
